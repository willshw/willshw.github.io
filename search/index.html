The package is very easy to setup and use; it works great for detecting tags or tag bundles and getting the transform between the camera and the tag on tag bundle.In my application, I had a camera attached to a robot arm, and the camera pointed to the AprilTags. With the apriltag2_ros package, I can easily lookup the transform from tag to the camera, and tag to the baselink of the robot.When the tf was initially setup from the tag to the baselink of the robot, the tag to baselink transform was not correct. The transform showed the tag had movements in x-axis and y-axis but there was only y-axis movement. In rviz, I noticed that the frame of the robot’s end effector didn’t align with the camera frame (they had a 90 degree difference around the z-axis), so I applied a static transform to tf to fix the problem.The AprilTag frame and camera frame are illustrated as below:(This should apply to all apriltags. Origin locates at the first pixel of the image sensor; it follows the convention of image coordinate.)The lesson here is to make sure you know the frame orientation of your camera and tag when using packages like apriltag2_ros, especially when the camera or tag needs to be attached to other tf nodes."

Because I don’t have cable and I don’t want to pay for online sport channel, I usually go to the free live steam websites to watch soccer games. While the free live stream websites do provide you live streams, a lot of annoying Ads will be placed in the middle of the stream window to block a big part of the stream, and these suckers are often cannot be closed.Here is my trick to get rid of them, as long as the Ads are not embeded into the steam video. You should be able to get rid of them if you are using browser like Chrome, maybe Firefox will work too.Follow the steps (in Chrome):  Open the live stream page with Chrome.  Right click on the streaming page.      Select Inspect, Chrome developer tools window will show up in your browser.        Go to the developer tools window, find elements tap on the very top, and select.  Now, a boat load of html code shows up. Don’t panic, stay calm. We are almost there.  You will see sections of the web page are highlighted as you place the pointer on the code blocks. Keep moving until the Ad is highlighted. Sometime you need to click on the little triangle to expand the code block and search for the code block for the Ad.      Right click on the Ad html code section, select hide element.            BOOM!!! The Ad is gone!!!.        Repeat 6 and 7 until all Ads are gone.For most Ads, AdBlock extensions can handle them, but there are always some Ads cannot be blocked.This hack may not be new to some people. I just discovered it recently and wanted to share with people who watch free sports livestream. This hack works on my favorite soccer streaming website. The only problem I have is I cannot enlarge the stream into full screen, and this may just be a problem of the web player. Also, I tried to find the live steam video url, and use VLC player to open and stream that url, but I coun’t find the right url. It would be much better to watch the game on VLC player.I will keep searching for better hacks for better viewing experience. For now, let’s just enjoy the games."

VHC equips with two motorized mirrors (mirrors mounted on motors) with rotational axes aligned perpendicularly and a fixed camera pointing at one of the mirrors. The two motorized mirrors can redirect the optical path of the mounted camera. With a motor controller, the stationary camera can virtually pan and tilt in a certain angular range in a tracked space volume.VHC can be integrated into a motion capture space where the location of actors and actresses can be accurately tracked in high refresh rate. VHC can quickly adjust the mirror angles, zoom, and focus, according to the motion tracking data centered the subject in the camera frame. A system of multiple VHCs installed in a motion tracking space can potentially replace the traditional head mounted camera system.This research project was one of my work projects at USC ICT, and it was presented at SIGGRAPH 2015 poster session.For more detailed of this project, please visit the project page on USC ICT Graphics Lab website."

At first, computer vision part of the program took care of extracting maze, ball tracking and final goal recognition. With all the vision information, then path planning program could solve for a global path plan to reach goal and dynamically solve for local path plans when the ball drifts off the global path plan. Finally, robot control program implemented PID controller on both joint velocity control and joint position control of the robot to manipulate the end effector to control the movement of the ball.In this project, I was responsible for writing the control program.

The goal of this project was to learn and explore motion planning, and implement a motion planning algorithms in a program. The program used sampling-based method to generate a motion plan for a dynamic vehicle.In this project, I aimed at reproducing the result from a research paper, Anytime computation of time-optimal off-road vehicle maneuvers using the RRT* from MIT. Authors of the paper proposed a solution to generate a kinodynamic motion plan for an off-road vehicle to drive through tight corners at high speed to achieve time-optimality. In the paper, authors employed a full dynamic model of a car which had taken the tire-road contact into account. With the full dynamic model, RRT-Star could find a plan that satisfied the vehicle dynamics. At extreme cases, motion plan for the vehicle is to slide from a state to another state.Vehicle Dynamics ModelVehicle dynamics model employed in this project was a bicycle model, and Pacejka’s Magic Formula was used for tire dynamics. The vehicle model had 8 states ($x$, $\dot{x}$, $y$, $\dot{y}$, $\Psi$, $\dot{\Psi}$, $\omega_F$, $\omega_R$), and 3 input value ($T_F$, $T_R$, $\delta$)Here is an illustration of the bicycle model:Notations:  $x$, $y$, $\dot{x}$, $\dot{y}$, $\ddot{x}$, $\ddot{y}$: Position, velocity, acceleration at the center of the vehicle  $m$: Mass of vehicle  $I_z$: Inertia of vehicle  $I_i$, $r_i$, $\omega_i$, $i =(F, R)$: Moment of inertia, radius, angular velocity of front and rear wheels  $f_{ij}$, $i=(F, R), j=(x, y)$: Longitudinal and lateral front and rear tire forces:  $\Psi$: Vehicle orientation/ yaw angle  $\beta$: Slip angle  $T_i$, $i=(F, R)$: Torque input at front and rear wheels  $\delta$: Steering angle inputEquation of motion:  $m\ddot{x} = f_{Fx}cos(\Psi + \delta) - f_{Fy}sin(\Psi + \delta) + f_{Rx}cos(\Psi) - f_{Ry}sin(\Psi)$  $m\ddot{y} = f_{Fx}sin(\Psi + \delta) + f_{Fy}cos(\Psi + \delta) + f_{Rx}sin(\Psi) + f_{Ry}cos(\Psi)$  $I_z\ddot{\Psi} = (f_{Fy}cos(\delta) + f_{Fx}sin(\delta))l_F - f_{Ry}l_R$  $I_F\dot{\omega}_ F = T_F - f_{Fx}r_F$  $I_R\dot{\omega}_ R = T_R - f_{Rx}r_R$Tire force $f_{ij}$ depends on normal force $f_z$ and friction coefficient $\mu_{ij}$ determined by Pacejka’s Magic Formula:  $f_{ij} = \mu_{ij}f_{iz} $  $(i = F,R, j=x,y)$  $\mu_{ij} = -\frac{s_{ij}}{s_i}\mu_i(s_i) $  $(i = F,R, j=x,y)$  $\mu_i(s_i) = D_i sin(C_i arctan(B_i s_i)) $   $(i = F,R)$For more details about the vehicle dynamic model, please refer to Anytime computation of time-optimal off-road vehicle maneuversusing the RRT*RRT-StarRRT-Star is a departure from the RRT. RRT-Star has modified the extend procedure which allows it to replan the nodes close to the newly inserted one. This procedure looks for the nodes that will have lower cost to reach from root after rewiring this node to the newly inserted one. This procedure garantees the sampling-based planner can find an solution and the solution is asymptotically optimal.RRT-Star Algorithm:RRT-Star with 10K Node (Path Planning):Planning SpaceThe full dynamic model of the car had 8 DOF ($x$, $\dot{x}$, $y$, $\dot{y}$, $\Psi$, $\dot{\Psi}$, $\omega_F$, $\omega_R$). Keeping track of 8 dimensional state space was rather complicated. To deal with this problem, planner only plans in a 4D task space in $x$, $y$, $V$($\sqrt{\dot{x}^2+\dot{y}^2}$), $\Psi$assuming the there was an mapping of the free space in 8 dimension state space to 4 dimension task space.ControlWhen solving for the control input needed for connecting current state and next state, I only solve for a constant control applied to the system. (Constant steering angle and constant acceleration) To solve for control, the vehicle dynamic equations were integrate to certain amount of time with initial conditions. Integration and optimization were all done using scipy functions. Since solving for an optimal control required integrating the stiff and non-linear ODE iteratively, it took some time to find the control that can take the vehicle from the current state to the new state.Here are two GIFs of vehicle following predefined states.  Red Arrow: Heading of Vehicle  Black Arrow: Steering Angle  Green Arrow: Veloity of VehicleCurrent StateThis project is expected to continue. This motion planning problem is rather complicated. The program was not efficient enough to find a complete motion plan in reasonable amount of time.Dfficulties Encountered:  The planner suffers from the performance issues of low efficiecy at searching for a set of constant control to connect two states  The rate of sampling a valid and reachable state was low thus sampling time was too long.  A valid cost to go function was also a key component to the solution missed.The planner was not able to finish the whole planning task as shown in following figures:                        Things be worked on:  A fast numerical solver for the stiff problem must need to implemented to improve the state connection calculation time.  Instead of looking for a fast ODE solver, utilizing a physics simulation engine to handle the state integration can be a great approach, since physics simulation engines are often fast at solving for complex physics model with some sacrifices on accuracy. (Focus on sovling motion planning instead of solving physics model)  Employing some probabilistic sampling techniques can improve the chance of sampling valid states.  In the future, the vehicle geometry also need to be taken into account for more realistic collision detection.Reference  hwan Jeon, Jeong, Sertac Karaman, and Emilio Frazzoli. “Anytime computation of time-optimal off-road vehicle maneuvers using the RRT.” Decision and Control and European Control Conference (CDC-ECC), 2011 50th IEEE Conference on.

                            "content"  : "AboutThis is my MSR program’s capstone project with Prof. Argall’s research lab at Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. The goal of this project is to build a ROS package that uses visual servoing technique and RGBD sensor to guide robotic arm to grasp an object without prior knowledge of the object (geometry model of the object). The ROS package is designed to be generic so it can be easily used for different type of robotic arms.Challenges and ApplicationsThe challenges this project will encounter includes a robust visual servoing control, point cloud processing on objects, grasp point generation, etc. Since the project aims at achieving grasping without a model, the problem just became much more difficult.If we want to integrate robots into our daily life to work efficiently around humans, grasping a wide range of object is a task they must master. While grasping is an easy task for humans, it takes quite a bit of effort for a robot to figure out how to grasp an object and pick up an object successfully. A satisfying result of this project can benefit robot applications like factor/warehouse oject sorting, personal assistant robot and home robots where manipulation tasks are required.Current ProgressBy 06-14-2018, a GitHub repository has been created with working position based visual servoing code.What’s Coming Up Next  Joint limit and singularity avoidance on position based visual servoing  Image base visual servoing  Visual servoing using RGBD camera  Visual servoing on object with known model  Visual servoing on object with unknown modelGithub"
