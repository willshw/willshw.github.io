## About

This is a project in collaboration with [Intelligent Flying Machine (IFM)][IFM] where I worked with IFM on a proprietary camera calibration process using a robot arm.

In this project, I programmed UR3 robot to automate extrinsic and intrinsic calibrations of camera rigs deployed in IFM's forklift vision systems [Onetrack][Onetrack.ai]. Also, I developed and refined proprietary camera calibration pipeline to enhance usability and calibration accuracy. In the calibration pipeline, my program optimized image data processing to locate camera rotational center at subpixel accuracy and generated maps for calibrated cameras to improve localization and estimation.

The calibration pipeline was developed in ROS environment.
