William is a student in [MS in Robotics][1] program at Northwestern University. He is especially interested in machine learning, computer vision, robot motion planning, and human-robot interaction, all of which could significantly improve a robot's ability to assist individuals.

William received his bachelor degree in mechanical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 2014. After graduating from UC Berkeley, he joined the [Graphics Lab][2] as a hardware engineer at the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies ([USC ICT][3]) in Los Angeles.

At USC ICT, William worked on various projects where he applied mechanical design, mechatronics and software engineering knowledge to design, engineer, and prototype new hardware and software systems. The projects he worked on include [Virtual Headcam][4], [Specular Object Scanner][5], [Light Stage X][6], camera network system, etc. In Virtual Headcam project, he and his colleagues engineered a dual motorized mirror device to redirect the optical path of a stationary camera for human facial-tracking purposes. The project was presented at ACM SIGGRAPH 2015 and achieved great results.

William enjoyed every aspect of working in a research lab, especially learning new technologies and solving challenging problems. Starting off his career in research immediately exposed him to a wide variety of technologies and great minds in research, and this experience helped him identify the type of work he wants to pursue in the future. William wishes to apply his robotics knowledge to different fields and continue to work as an engineer and adventurer in R&D in the future.
